  [[https://builtwithnix.org][https://img.shields.io/badge/Built_With-Nix-5277C3.svg?logo=nixos&labelColor=73C3D5]]

  A collection of machine configurations, expressed in [[https://nixos.org/nix][Nix]]

** Usage
   This repository is based on [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes][Nix Flakes]], an experimental feature of Nix that solves some of the problems around hermeticism.
   To learn more about Flakes, I highly recommend reading the "Nix Flakes" series by Eelco himself:

*** Homebrew
    With the absence of some tooling in nixpkgs, the Darwin machines defined in this repository lean on nix-darwin's Homebrew module
    to manage some packages, App Store apps, and macOS Applications. For this to work, Homebrew must be installed.

    Don't forget to turn off analytics!
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    brew analytics off
    #+END_EXAMPLE
   
*** deploy-rs
    For management of remote systems, I use [[https://github.com/serokell/deploy-rs][serokell/deploy-rs]]

** Machines
   There are several machines defined in =flake.nix=
 
*** macbook
    As you might've guessed from the name, this is my personal MacBook.
    It provides a darwin environment of which every aspect is expressed, including: [[https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai][yabai]], [[https://github.com/cmacrae/spacebar][spacebar]], [[https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd][skhd]], [[https://cmacr.ae/post/2020-05-09-managing-firefox-on-macos-with-nix/][Firefox profiles]]
    with [[conf.d/userChrome.css][a minimal theme (Ã  la surf/xombrero)]], [[https://github.com/cmacrae/emacs][nightly Emacs (with native comp, WebKit support, libvterm)]],
    [[conf.d/emacs.org][literate Emacs config]] with [[https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay/#extra-library-functionality][declarative use-package statements]], [[modules/mbsync.nix][an mbsync module]] for mail retrieval for use with [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]], 
    declarative Homebrew packages/casks for macOS Application installation, and various other pieces.
    
*** workbook
    My work MacBook. The same as macbook but with some work specific configuration layered on top.

*** net1
    A Raspberry Pi 4 that acts as a DHCP (ISC) server, DNS (unbound) server, and [[https://www.wireguard.com/][Wireguard]] gateway for my home network.

*** compute1, compute2, compute3
    3 Intel NUCs that occupy 1u in my cabinet. The workhorses of my home lab.
    They're not doing much interesting stuff at the moment, but I have some custom Nix tooling used to provision them into
    a Kubernetes cluster built on [[https://cri-o.io/][CRI-O]], [[https://cilium.io/][Cilium]], and [[https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/][Argo CD]] which I'll be making public soon enough.
